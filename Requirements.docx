Test Strategy
-------------
Perform Functional testing of all the functionalities mentioned in the above Scope section.

As part of Functional Testing, the following approach will be followed for Testing:

Step 1: Creation of Test Scenarios and Test Cases for the different features in Scope.
    * Several Test Designing Techniques will be applied while creating Test Cases.
        - Equivalence Class Partition
        - Boundary Value Analysis
        - Decision Table Testing
        - State Transition Testing
        - Use Case Testing
    * Use expertise in creating Test Cases by applying:
        - Error Guessing
        - Exploratory Testing
    * Prioritising the Test Cases.
    
Step 2: The Testing Process upon receipt of Application to be Tested.
    * Firstly, perform Smoke Testing to check whether the different and important functionalities of the application are working.
    * Reject the build if Smoke Testing fails and wait for a stable build before performing in-depth testing of the application functionalities.
    * Upon receipt of a stable build that passes Smoke Testing, perform in-depth testing using the Test Cases created.
    * Multiple Test Resources will be testing the same application on multiple supported environments simultaneously.
    * Report bugs in bug tracking tool and send the defects found on that day in a status end of day email.
    * Perform the following tests as part of the entire testing:
        - Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing
        - Regression Testing and Re-Testing
        - Usability Testing, Functionality and UI Testing.
    * Repeat Test Cycles until a quality product is obtained.
    
Step 3: Follow the best practices to make testing better.
    * Context Driven Testing: Perform testing as per the content of the given application.
    * Shift Left Testing: Start testing from the beginning of development itself instead of waiting for the stable build.
    * Exploratory Testing: Using expertise, perform Exploratory Testing apart from the normal execution of the Test Cases.
    * End-to-End Flow Testing: Test the End-to-End scenario which involves multiple functionalities to simulate the end user flow.

Defect Reporting Procedure
--------------------------
During the test execution:
    * Any deviation from expected behavior by the application will be  noted. If it can't be reported as a defect, it will be reported as an observation/issue or posed as a question.
    * Any usability issues will be reported.
    * After discovery of a defect, it will be re-tested to verify reproductibility of the defect. Screenshots with steps to reproduce will be documented.
    * At the end of the test execution each day, defects encountered will be sent along with the observations.
Note:
    * Defects will be documented in excel.
    * Test scenarios and Test cases will be documented in an excel documnet.
